df_1 contains the raw data from our rawdata.csv
head is used to display the data like head(10) how many rows to display
isnull() is used to check for clumns with null values
we convert frailty from categorical to numerical
Now we consider fratilty as predictor and Age,weight and Height as independant variable and checking the correlation between them. 
I am using logistics regression  model to display the correlation.
